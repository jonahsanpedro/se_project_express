# Project 12 - Express.js for WTWR Application

In this project we were instructed to build the server-side of our What to Wear project. It introduced express.js, the use of MongoDB, Postman as well as Github Actions. With MongoDB we created databases and were able to change objects in arrays if applicable. In Postman, we are able to test our code and learn to troubleshoot errors on our own. This is similar with the use of Github Actions as well.

Throughout this project we set up a backend Api, gained more practice on route handling, and database connection. The challenging parts of this project were making sure our controllers worked properly with correct syntax and application. Working through failures in Postman helped me to develop more comprehension on express.js and understanding how routes and controllers are tasked.

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
